Project 1 had two components. First, we worked through an example of what 
github collaboration looks like. Each group member cloned a central
repository and created a personal branch. Then, we made a pull reques to
merge our changes into the core repository. 

In the second part of the project, we each created a personal github page. 
The page shows some biographical information along with a description of our 
first project.
